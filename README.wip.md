### Hello!
I am a localized bird who does random things on GitHub to try and improve own skills one at a time, and i mainly contribute to other projects if i feel like it.

- :telescope: I am a official moderator for the [Fabulously Optimized](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) modpack on Discord, and I'm a helper on Mojang's bug tracker nicknamed [Mojira](https://bugs.mojang.com) (and various bots we've made are open-source in the [**@mojira**](https://github.com/mojira) organization),
- :penguin: I love using Linux, but haven't found the time to daily-drive it yet,
- :computer: I own and maintain many random [Python projects](https://github.com/osfanbuff63?tab=repositories&language=python) and [Minecraft datapacks](https://github.com/osfanbuff63?tab=repositories&language=mcfunction). My GitHub stats say that I have a lot of repositories in Java, but they are almost all forks for some small README.md change or an Actions improvement.

<sub><sup><sup>stole this readme from [Kichura](https://github.com/Kichura) just to make my own one out of it. hehe! <s>and also because it was so good</s></sup></sup></sup>
