### Hello!
I'm osfanbuff63. I'm not sure what else to put here ðŸ˜…

- :telescope: I am a official moderator for the [Fabulously Optimized](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB) modpack on Discord, and I'm a helper on Mojang's bug tracker nicknamed [Mojira](https://bugs.mojang.com) (and various bots we've made are open-source in the [**@mojira**](https://github.com/mojira) organization).
- :penguin: I love using Linux, but haven't found the time to daily-drive it yet (for various reasons).
- :computer: I own and maintain many random [Python projects](https://github.com/osfanbuff63?tab=repositories&language=python) (especially [this one](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/vanilla-installer)) and [Minecraft datapacks](https://github.com/osfanbuff63?tab=repositories&language=mcfunction). My GitHub stats say that I have a lot of repositories in Java, but they are almost all forks for some small README.md change or an Actions improvement. Newer projects of mine are on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/osfanbuff63) - some are mirrored back to GitHub but most aren't.
- :elephant: I have a [Mastodon account](https://blobfox.coffee/@osfanbuff63) that I'll post on occasionally.
- :link: Most important links can be found [here](https://wheretofind.me/@osfanbuff63). on [Where to Find Me](https://wheretofind.me).

<sup><sup><sup>stole this readme from [Kichura](https://github.com/Kichura) just to make my own one out of it. hehe! <s>and also because it was so good</s></sup></sup></sup>
